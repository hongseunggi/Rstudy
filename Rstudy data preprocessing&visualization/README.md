## Data preprocessing and visualization

### Data preprocessing
Usually Data is very complex so programmers have difficulty processing data
Data preprocessing is best way solve this problem
this code present some example, How to using R language for data preprocessing
example, how to handle missing value in matrix and Dataframe or Handle outlier
Sort Vector data, matrix, Dataframe and How to split data and select...etc   
this code very simple so anyone can try it and learn it   
Data preprocessing is most important thing in Data anaylsis, because most of aggregated data file is mass and complex
so if you want to learn about Data analysis, learn data preprocessing first 

### Data visualization
Until now we learn about how to use R langguage and how to handle mess data
and this step give you learn about Visualization   
Data visualization is to visualize the data....so.. what data?  
before visualize data, you must know about data preprocessing, if data was not preprocessing, learn about visualization data is 
Meaningless   
this code present How to use treemap or ggplot package  
Using treemap and ggplot, you can see bar graph or mosaic plot which Processed data configured   
Try it and learn about how to use it
